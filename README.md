# INFO3130-midterm
Created by Ian Van Harten

### About This Project
This project is an e-commerce website for a Sneaker Shop. The home page displays a collection of sneakers for sale, and each one links to a details page which has more details about the sneakers. I developed this project for my midterm for INFO3130 in the Fall 2022 semester.

The website is being deployed using GitHub Pages and you can view it at this link: https://ianvanharten.com/INFO3130-midterm/index.html

### Navigating the Repo
There are several tabs near the top of the page which you can use to navigate around the repo. The Code tab displays the code files and assets for the website. The Issues tab is where you can view the various issues created for the project. Those are the two main tabs of interest.

### For Developers and Contributers
If you want to contribute to this project, navigate to the Code tab and click on the big green 'Code' button. This button will open a dropdown where you can copy the HTTPS clone link for the project. Open up your command terminal, navigate to the folder where you would like to store the project, then enter 'git clone <HTTPS-link>. This will download the project to your selected directory. 

### Version Control and Testing Process
For any changes, best practice is to make a branch off of the main branch, make your changes there and then create a pull request. I will review the changes and merge it into main or request any other changes on it first. Make sure to test your changes before creating the PR. You can create unit tests for any added features and test it live as well to ensure that it works.

In order to see it live, I recommend using Live Server in Visual Studio Code which will serve up the website live on your local machine. Alternatively, you can also open up the index.html file in your preferred internet browser and you will see the live website that way as well. Once it is open, you can view the home page and see the catalogue of sneakers displayed there. If you click on one of them it will navigate you to the details page where you can view more details about the product. There is a button there to add the product to your cart.

Please note that the website is not yet complete. The 'Add to Cart' button is not yet functional, and the details page only exists for one of the sneakers. Each product link will only take you to that one product. 

### Reporting Bugs or Ideas for New Features

For any bugs you discover or ideas for features you think would enhance the project, please create an issue in the Issues tab noted above. For bugs, make sure to be very specific and include instructions for how to replicate it. Once I am able to recreate it, I will make the change or invite you to contribute a fix yourself if you would like to do that.
